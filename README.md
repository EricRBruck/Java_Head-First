Java Head First Review
======================

As a review of Java I am going through the book "Head First Java" 2nd Edition front to back.  In the process I will be coding all Exercises for practice.  For me the best way to learn is by doing.  I will be reading the chapter for background knowledge / refresh on the subject, then doing the exercises to apply the the chapter content to programs.

>"Head First Java is a complete learning experience in Java and object-oriented programming.  This book helps you learn the Java Language with a unique method that does beyond syntax and how-to manuals and helps you understand how to be a great programmer.  You'll learn language fundamentals, generics, threading, networking, and distributed programming, and you'll even build a "sink the dot com" game and networked drum machine chat client along the way."
